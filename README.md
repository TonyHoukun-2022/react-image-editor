You can drag the slider sideways to adjust the corresponding image effect, and those effects will be applied on the overlay of the image. Therefore you can preview the image effect in this app.

This app offers a set of image effect editing capability through sliders, including opacity, blur, brightness, contrast, grayscale, hue-rotate, saturation and sepia. 

You can click the "upload image tag" on the page to upload local image which you want to edit.

On the bottom of the page, you can choose to download the edited image to your local machine, which has the new file name with the suffix "-edited" at the end, therefore you will not have it conflicts with your original image file. 

You can remove all applied filters at one go when you click the "remove filter" button. And you can apply your filters back to the overlay after you click the "apply filter"
